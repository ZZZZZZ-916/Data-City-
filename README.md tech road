# AR Data City: An Immersive Platform for Spatio-Temporal Visualization of Complex Market Dynamics

**AR Data City is an interactive 3D/AR data visualization platform that transmutes complex, high-dimensional time-series data from the game industry into an immersive, navigable virtual cityscape for advanced analytics and insight discovery.**


## Core Concept: Beyond Dashboards, Towards "Embodied" Data Cognition

Traditional analysis of market dynamics relies on 2D dashboards and spreadsheets. While effective, these paradigms lack the intuitive and narrative power required to holistically grasp complex, interrelated phenomena. **AR Data City** is conceived to transcend these limitations by leveraging spatial representation as a primary tool for data cognition. The core thesis is that by "walking through" a physicalized representation of data, analysts can more intuitively perceive trends, identify anomalies, and understand causal relationships over time.

This project is an exploration in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Data Visualization, and Machine Learning, aiming to create novel paradigms for interacting with and understanding complex, longitudinal datasets.

## Key Features

üîå Heterogeneous Data Fusion Pipeline**: Implements a robust data engineering pipeline to ingest, clean, and integrate time-series data from disparate, public sources. This includes concurrent user metrics (CCU) from Steam, concurrent viewership data (CCV) from Twitch as a proxy for market attention, and application rankings as a proxy for revenue potential. This process creates a comprehensive and reproducible data foundation.
üèôÔ∏è Dynamic Spatial Layouts**: The system maps abstract data entities to a dynamic urban landscape. The world can be procedurally reconfigured to represent different analytical perspectives, such as a "Studio View" (where districts represent publishers) or a "Genre View" (where districts represent game genres), facilitating multi-faceted trend analysis.
üé® Real-Time Visual Encoding**: Every visual attribute within the cityscape is algorithmically bound to a core data metric. The **height** of a structure represents its stable user base (e.g., 7-day median CCU), a **luminescent halo** highlights recent peak performance (PCCU), while ambient **particle systems** around a structure visualize its real-time community engagement (Twitch CCV).
‚è≥ Spatio-Temporal Replay System**: A core feature is an interactive temporal control mechanism, allowing users to scrub through time. This transforms the static city into a dynamic animation, enabling the direct observation of how key events (e.g., software patches, marketing campaigns) propagate through and impact the entire market ecosystem.
üß† AI-Powered Insight Engine (Prism-Analyzer)**: An integrated multi-modal analysis module (**currently in development**) that applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract sentiment scores from unstructured community reviews. This introduces a qualitative, sentiment-based data layer, allowing the city to visualize not just *what* is happening, but *how the community feels* about it.
